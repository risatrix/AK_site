AK_site
=======

My long-standing, well-worn portfolio site. It's deliberately stripped down at this point - one page, HTML/CSS, a little JS interaction for fun, and JS slider plugin -- and okay, okay, the PHP so I can give it some structure. I could replace that 
with a JS templating engine, or a static stie generator, I suppose. I could do a lot of things, but considering [how infrequently I update it](http://xkcd.com/1205/), I'm content to leave it as is. 

I've also gone back and forth about replacing the site with a light CMS, but the truth is I like having plain HTML/CSS to play with. Because this a site I keep for myself, I hope you'll forgive the somewhat casual approach to commit messages. Though, to be fair,  I've also gotten a lot better at structure, consistency and whitespace over the years.
