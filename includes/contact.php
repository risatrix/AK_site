<p> If you don't like contact forms (see right) I'm on 
<a href="https://twitter.com/WorstProfEver" target="_blank">Twitter</a> a lot. Though some have deemed the variety of my Twitter interests "unbrandable," I like to think of it as well-rounded.<br>&nbsp;<br>Let me guess, you want to know if I'm on Git. The answer is <a href="https://github.com/risatrix" target="_blank">yes</a>, but I'm still trying to erase all the Tweets from the rocky start of our
relationship, and we're seeing a therapist to strengthen our bond. We'd appreciate it if you respected our privacy.
